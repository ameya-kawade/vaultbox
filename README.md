## Overview

VaultBox is engineered for modern enterprises and individual users who require uncompromised control over their data. By integrating a variety of open-source tools and in-house developments, VaultBox delivers a unified experience that encompasses:

- **Secure Communication:** Real-time chat with end-to-end encryption and cipher modes ensuring data integrity and confidentiality.
- **Seamless Meetings:** Integrated video conferencing via Jitsi Meet, embedded directly into the frontend.
- **Decentralized File Storage:** Minio-powered storage with robust encryption to safeguard sensitive files.
- **Dynamic Authentication:** OTP-based authentication providing secure access to the platform.
- **Scalability:** Designed with a microservices architecture and containerization to ensure high availability and load balancing.

## Features

- **Privacy by Design:** Emphasizes data ownership with no reliance on external third-party services.
- **End-to-End Encrypted Chat:** Utilizes Node.js, Express, and Socket.io with a Redis adapter to efficiently handle real-time communication in a clustered environment.
- **OTP-based Authentication:** Secure user verification via one-time passwords, enhancing access security.
- **Integrated Video Conferencing:** Jitsi Meet is seamlessly integrated into the frontend using the React SDK.
- **Robust File Storage:** Powered by Minio with built-in end-to-end encryption for secure file management.
- **Advanced Encryption Techniques:** React-based frontend uses Kyber for encrypting messages and securely stores keys in IndexedDB.
- **Cipher Mode:** Innovative communication mode where messages appear obfuscated during transit yet render correctly on the recipient’s device.
- **Load Balancing:** Nginx as a reverse proxy to manage load balancing across chat and authentication services.
- **Containerization:** Docker is utilized for deploying Minio, MongoDB, Nginx, Jitsi Meet, and Node.js applications for streamlined operations and maintenance.

## Architecture

VaultBox leverages a microservices architecture to decouple services and ensure resilience and scalability. Key architectural highlights include:

- **Microservices Deployment:** Each core functionality—chat, authentication, file storage, and video conferencing—is encapsulated within its own service.
- **Containerized Environment:** Docker containers are used to deploy and manage services, simplifying orchestration and enhancing system reliability.
- **Scalable Communication:** The chat system is designed using Node.js clustering, with a Redis adapter integrated into Socket.io to efficiently manage real-time communications across multiple instances.
- **Load Balancing:** Nginx efficiently distributes incoming requests to ensure high availability and fault tolerance.
- **End-to-End Security:** All data exchanges are encrypted, with additional encryption layers applied at the file and message level to secure user data.

## Security Considerations

VaultBox incorporates multiple layers of security to ensure data privacy and integrity:

- **End-to-End Encryption:** All communications, including chat messages and file transfers, are encrypted.
- **OTP-Based Authentication:** Enhances user verification and secures access to services.
- **Container Isolation:** Docker containers provide isolated environments for each service, reducing the risk of cross-service vulnerabilities.
- **Reverse Proxy Security:** Nginx ensures secure and efficient load balancing, protecting backend services from direct exposure.

## Future Enhancements

- **AI-Powered Threat Detection:** Incorporate machine learning algorithms to detect and mitigate potential security threats.
- **Expanded Protocol Support:** Integrate additional secure communication protocols to further enhance data privacy.
